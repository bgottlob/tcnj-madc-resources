# TCNJ Mobile Application Development Club

Welcome to TCNJ MADC's official GitHub repo, where you can find club announcements and resources from tutorials given at meetings.

This semester, meetings will be held every **Wednesday from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **AIMM 223**. Please note that we will be meeting in AIMM 223 until further notice, since we'll be able to access Xcode there.

## This Week's Meeting: Free Project Session

This week's meeting will take place on **Wednesday, November 18 at 4:30 in AIMM 223**. Come to join the trading card inventory tracker app team or work on an app idea of your own. Feel free to use the time to bounce ideas around, find others to work with you, or get help with launching your app idea. The rest of the weekly meetings for this semester will be taking this format.
