# TCNJ Mobile Application Development Club

Welcome to TCNJ MADC's official GitHub repo, where you can find club announcements and resources from tutorials given at meetings.

This semester, meetings will (tentatively) be held every **Wednesday from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Linux Lab** on the fourth floor of Forcina. We may need to move meetings to one of the Mac labs in the IMM building for iOS tutorials so everyone has access to Xcode.

## This Week's Meeting: Objects and Classes in Swift

This week's meeting will take place on Wednesday, October 14 at 4:30 in the Forcina Linux Lab. I'll be giving a tutorial on creating functions, classes, and objects in Swift. Since a fair number of you know Java already, the object oriented concepts will be a review. However, those concepts will become very important when building iOS apps, so we'll spend this meeting understanding them (and implementing them in Swift) so that everyone is up to speed. The tutorial will mirror [this one by Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/114234/learn-to-code-ios-apps-with-swift-tutorial-3-arrays-objects-and-classes). Before the meeting, I'll update our GitHub repo with example code and an outline of the tutorial.

## The Meeting Before Last Week's Meeting

We had a short meeting discussing some basics of Swift. Not much was covered due to time constraints, but you can view some tutorials on Swift syntax on [this page](https://github.com/bgottlob/tcnj-madc-resources/blob/master/ios/tutorials.md)
