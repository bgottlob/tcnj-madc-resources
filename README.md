# TCNJ Mobile Application Development Club

Welcome to TCNJ MADC's official GitHub repo, where you can find club announcements and resources from tutorials given at meetings.

This semester, meetings will (tentatively) be held every **Wednesday from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Linux Lab** on the fourth floor of Forcina. We may need to move meetings to one of the Mac labs in the IMM building for iOS tutorials so everyone has access to Xcode.

## This Week's Meeting: Objects and Classes in Swift

This week's meeting will take place on **Wednesday, October 21 at 4:30 in the Forcina Linux Lab**. Matt Judy will be covering some Anrdoid basics and an introduction to Android Studio.

## Previous Meetings

10/14/15: This meeting covered creating functions, classes, and objects in Swiftx. The tutorial mirrors [this one from Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/114234/learn-to-code-ios-apps-with-swift-tutorial-3-arrays-objects-and-classes). The code from this tutorial is available on this repo under the `ios` folder.

9/23/15: At this meeting, we discussed some basics of Swift. Not much was covered due to time constraints, but you can view some tutorials on Swift syntax on [this page](https://github.com/bgottlob/tcnj-madc-resources/blob/master/ios/tutorials.md)
